# Smile-Detection-using-OPENCV-with-haarcascades
This is a smile detection program which uses OPENCV in python and other python libraries such as NUMPY for its implemention. Instead of training the model myself, I have used premade haarcascades for face detection as well as smile detection. I have attached the screenshots of the result of code as well.
